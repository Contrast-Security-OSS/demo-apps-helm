# Vulnerable Demo Applications - Helm Charts

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of Helm charts for various deliberately vulnerable demo applications. These applications are designed to showcase the effectiveness of Contrast's runtime security in detecting vulnerabilities and preventing exploits in real-time.

## Getting Started

The helm index is intended to be consumed by the Contrast Demo environment (based on Kubeapps), but these helm charts could also be deployed directly to a cluster.

### Guidelines for adding a new chart

#TODO

## GitHub Action for Helm Index

This repository includes a GitHub Action configured to automatically update the Helm chart repository index file whenever changes are pushed to the charts which are stored in separate folders. This ensures that the latest versions of the Helm charts are always available for use. 

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the demo applications or the Helm charts, just submit a PR.
